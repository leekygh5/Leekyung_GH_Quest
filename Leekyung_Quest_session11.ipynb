physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\\n    the Form complete is worthier far,\\nThe Female equally with the Male I sing.\\n\\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\\nCheerful, for freest action form\\'d under the laws divine,\\nThe Modern Man I sing.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  As I Ponder\\'d in Silence\\n\\nAs I ponder\\'d in silence,\\nReturning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\\nA Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\\nTerrible in beauty, age, and power,\\nThe genius of poets of old lands,\\nAs to me directing like flame its eyes,\\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\\nKnow\\'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever-enduring bards?\\nAnd that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.\\n\\nBe it so, then I answer\\'d,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr\\'d and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  In Cabin\\'d Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin\\'d ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy\\'d on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\\n\\nHere are our thoughts, voyagers\\' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o\\'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean\\'s poem.\\n\\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos\\'d I know not\\n    whither, yet ever full of faith,\\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\\n    here in every leaf;)\\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\\n    imperious waves,\\nChant on, sail on, bear o\\'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Foreign Lands\\n\\nI heard that you ask\\'d for something to prove this puzzle the New World,\\nAnd to define America, her athletic Democracy,\\nTherefore I send you my poems that you behold in them what you wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Historian\\n\\nYou who celebrate bygones,\\nWho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races, the life\\n    that has exhibited itself,\\nWho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates,\\n    rulers and priests,\\nI, habitan of the Alleghanies, treating of him as he is in himself\\n    in his own rights,\\nPressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself,\\n    (the great pride of man in himself,)\\nChanter of Personality, outlining what is yet to be,\\nI project the history of the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Thee Old Cause\\n\\nTo thee old cause!\\nThou peerless, passionate, good cause,\\nThou stern, remorseless, sweet idea,\\nDeathless throughout the ages, races, lands,\\nAfter a strange sad war, great war for thee,\\n(I think all war through time was really fought, and ever will be\\n    really fought, for thee,)\\nThese chants for thee, the eternal march of thee.\\n\\n(A war O soldiers not for itself alone,\\nFar, far more stood silently waiting behind, now to advance in this book.)\\n\\nThou orb of many orbs!\\nThou seething principle! thou well-kept, latent germ! thou centre!\\nAround the idea of thee the war revolving,\\nWith all its angry and vehement play of causes,\\n(With vast results to come for thrice a thousand years,)\\nThese recitatives for thee,--my book and the war are one,\\nMerged in its spirit I and mine, as the contest hinged on thee,\\nAs a wheel on its axis turns, this book unwitting to itself,\\nAround the idea of thee.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Eidolons\\n\\n     I met a seer,\\nPassing the hues and objects of the world,\\nThe fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,\\n     To glean eidolons.\\n\\n     Put in thy chants said he,\\nNo more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in,\\nPut first before the rest as light for all and entrance-song of all,\\n     That of eidolons.\\n\\n     Ever the dim beginning,\\nEver the growth, the rounding of the circle,\\nEver the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,)\\n     Eidolons! eidolons!\\n\\n     Ever the mutable,\\nEver materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering,\\nEver the ateliers, the factories divine,\\n     Issuing eidolons.\\n\\n     Lo, I or you,\\nOr woman, man, or state, known or unknown,\\nWe seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,\\n     But really build eidolons.\\n\\n     The ostent evanescent,\\nThe substance of an artist\\'s mood or savan\\'s studies long,\\nOr warrior\\'s, martyr\\'s, hero\\'s toils,\\n     To fashion his eidolon.\\n\\n     Of every human life,\\n(The units gather\\'d, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)\\nThe whole or large or small summ\\'d, added up,\\n     In its eidolon.\\n\\n     The old, old urge,\\nBased on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,\\nFrom science and the modern still impell\\'d,\\n     The old, old urge, eidolons.\\n\\n     The present now and here,\\nAmerica\\'s busy, teeming, intricate whirl,\\nOf aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing,\\n     To-day\\'s eidolons.\\n\\n     These with the past,\\nOf vanish\\'d lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea,\\nOld conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors\\' voyages,\\n     Joining eidolons.\\n\\n     Densities, growth, facades,\\nStrata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,\\nFar-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,\\n     Eidolons everlasting.\\n\\n     Exalte, rapt, ecstatic,\\nThe visible but their womb of birth,\\nOf orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,\\n     The mighty earth-eidolon.\\n\\n     All space, all time,\\n(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\\nSwelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,)\\n     Fill\\'d with eidolons only.\\n\\n     The noiseless myriads,\\nThe infinite oceans where the rivers empty,\\nThe separate countless free identities, like eyesight,\\n     The true realities,

of entities, eidolons.\\n\\n     Unfix\\'d yet fix\\'d,\\nEver shall be, ever have been and are,\\nSweeping the present to the infinite future,\\n     Eidolons, eidolons, eidolons.\\n\\n     The prophet and the bard,\\nShall yet maintain themselves, in higher stages yet,\\nShall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy, interpret yet to them,\\n     God and eidolons.\\n\\n     And thee my soul,\\nJoys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations,\\nThy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet,\\n     Thy mates, eidolons.\\n\\n     Thy body permanent,\\nThe body lurking there within thy body,\\nThe only purport of the form thou art, the real I myself,\\n     An image, an eidolon.\\n\\n     Thy very songs not in thy songs,\\nNo special strains to sing, none for itself,\\nBut from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,\\n     A round full-orb\\'d eidolon.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  For Him I Sing\\n\\nFor him I sing,\\nI raise the present on the past,\\n(As some perennial tree out of its roots, the present on the past,)\\nWith time and space I him dilate and fuse the immortal laws,\\nTo make himself by them the law unto himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  When I Read the Book\\n\\nWhen I read the book, the biography famous,\\nAnd is this then (said I) what the author calls a man\\'s life?\\nAnd so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?\\n(As if any man really knew aught of my life,\\nWhy even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,\\nOnly a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections\\nI seek for my own use to trace out here.)\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginning My Studies\\n\\nBeginning my studies the first step pleas\\'d me so much,\\nThe mere fact consciousness, these forms, the power of motion,\\nThe least insect or animal, the senses, eyesight, love,\\nThe first step I say awed me and pleas\\'d me so much,\\nI have hardly gone and hardly wish\\'d to go any farther,\\nBut stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Beginners\\n\\nHow they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)\\nHow dear and dreadful they are to the earth,\\nHow they inure to themselves as much as to any--what a paradox\\n    appears their age,\\nHow people respond to them, yet know them not,\\nHow there is something relentless in their fate all times,\\nHow all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,\\nAnd how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same\\n    great purchase.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To the States\\n\\nTo the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist\\n    much, obey little,\\nOnce unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\\nOnce fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever\\n    afterward resumes its liberty.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  On Journeys Through the States\\n\\nOn journeys through the States we start,\\n(Ay through the world, urged by these songs,\\nSailing henceforth to every land, to every sea,)\\nWe willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.\\n\\nWe have watch\\'d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on,\\nAnd have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the\\n    seasons, and effuse as much?\\n\\nWe dwell a while in every city and town,\\nWe pass through Kanada, the North-east, the vast valley of the\\n    Mississippi, and the Southern States,\\nWe confer on equal terms with each of the States,\\nWe make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear,\\nWe say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the\\n    body and the soul,\\nDwell a while and pass on, be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,\\nAnd what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,\\nAnd may be just as much as the seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Certain Cantatrice\\n\\nHere, take this gift,\\nI was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or general,\\nOne who should serve the good old cause, the great idea, the\\n    progress and freedom of the race,\\nSome brave confronter of despots, some daring rebel;\\nBut I see that what I was reserving belongs to you just as much as to any.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Me Imperturbe\\n\\nMe imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,\\nMaster of all or mistress of all, aplomb in the midst of irrational things,\\nImbued as they, passive, receptive, silent as they,\\nFinding my occupation, poverty, notoriety, foibles, crimes, less\\n    important than I thought,\\nMe toward the Mexican sea, or in the Mannahatta or the Tennessee,\\n    or far north or inland,\\nA river man, or a man of the woods or of any farm-life of these\\n    States or of the coast, or the lakes or Kanada,\\nMe wherever my life is lived, O to be self-balanced for contingencies,\\nTo confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as\\n    the trees and animals do.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Savantism\\n\\nThither as I look I see each result and glory retracing itself and\\n    nestling close, always obligated,\\nThither hours, months, years--thither trades, compacts,\\n    establishments, even the most minute,\\nThither every-day life, speech, utensils, politics, persons, estates;\\nThither we also, I with my leaves and songs, trustful, admirant,\\nAs a father to his father going takes his children along with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  The Ship Starting\\n\\nLo, the unbounded sea,\\nOn its breast a ship starting, spreading all sails, carrying even\\n    her moonsails.\\nThe pennant is flying aloft as she speeds she speeds so stately--\\n    below emulous waves press forward,\\nThey surround the ship with shining curving motions and foam.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  I Hear America Singing\\n\\nI hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,\\nThose of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,\\nThe carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,\\nThe mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,\\nThe boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand\\n    singing on the steamboat deck,\\nThe shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as\\n    he stands,\\nThe wood-cutter\\'s song, the ploughboy\\'s on his way in the morning,\\n    or at noon intermission or at sundown,\\nThe delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work,\\n    or of the girl sewing or washing,\\nEach singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,\\nThe day what belongs to the day--at night the party of young\\n    fellows, robust, friendly,\\nSinging with open mouths their strong melodious songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  What Place Is Besieged?\\n\\nWhat place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?\\nLo, I send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal,\\nAnd with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,\\nAnd artillery-men, the deadliest that ever fired gun.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Still Though the One I Sing\\n\\nStill though the one I sing,\\n(One, yet of contradictions made,) I dedicate to Nationality,\\nI leave in him revolt, (O latent right of insurrection!

my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\\n\\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.\\n\\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\\nWalt you contain enough, why don\\'t you let it out then?\\n\\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\\n    articulation,\\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?\\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,\\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search\\n    of this day.)\\n\\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,\\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\\n\\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\\n\\n     26\\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.\\n\\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames,\\n    clack of sticks cooking my meals,\\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,\\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,\\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of\\n    work-people at their meals,\\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,\\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing\\n    a death-sentence,\\nThe heave\\'e\\'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the\\n    refrain of the anchor-lifters,\\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking\\n    engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color\\'d lights,\\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,\\nThe slow march play\\'d at the head of the association marching two and two,\\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\\n\\nI hear the violoncello, (\\'tis the young man\\'s heart\\'s complaint,)\\nI hear the key\\'d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\\n\\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\\nAh this indeed is music--this suits me.\\n\\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\\n\\nI hear the train\\'d soprano (what work with hers is this?)\\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess\\'d them,\\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick\\'d by the indolent waves,\\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\\nSteep\\'d amid honey\\'d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,\\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\\nAnd that we call Being.\\n\\n     27\\nTo be in any form, what is that?\\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)\\nIf nothing lay more develop\\'d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\\n\\nMine is no callous shell,\\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\\n\\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\\nTo touch my person to some one else\\'s is about as much as I can stand.\\n\\n     28\\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly\\n    different from myself,\\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,\\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,\\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\\n\\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.\\n\\nI am given up by traitors,\\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\\n    greatest traitor,\\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\\n\\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,\\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\\n\\n     29\\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath\\'d hooded sharp-tooth\\'d touch!\\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\\n\\nParting track\\'d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,\\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\\n\\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,\\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\\n\\n     30\\nAll truths wait in all things,\\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\\n\\nLogic and sermons never convince,\\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\\n\\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\\n\\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\\n    becomes omnific,\\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\\n\\n     31\\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars,\\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg\\n    of the wren,\\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d\\'oeuvre for the highest,\\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\\nAnd the cow crunching with depress\\'d head surpasses any statue,\\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.\\n\\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\\n    grains, esculent roots,\\nAnd am stucco\\'d with quadrupeds and birds all over,\\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\\n\\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,\\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder\\'d bones,\\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,\\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\\nIn vain the razor-bill\\'d auk sails far north to Labrador,\\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\\n\\n     32\\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\\n    self-contain\\'d,\\nI stand and look at them long and long.\\n\\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\\n    owning things,\\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of\\n    years ago,\\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\\n\\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their\\n    possession.\\n\\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?\\n\\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\\n\\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\\n\\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.\\n\\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\\n\\n     33\\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess\\'d at,\\nWhat I guess\\'d when I loaf\\'d on the grass,\\nWhat I guess\\'d while I lay alone in my bed,\\nAnd again as I walk\\'d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\\n\\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\\nI am afoot with my vision.\\n\\nBy the city\\'s quadrangular houses--in log huts, camping with lumber-men,\\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,\\nWeeding my onion-patch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips,\\n    crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,\\nScorch\\'d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the\\n    shallow river,\\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the\\n    buck turns furiously at the hunter,\\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the\\n    otter is feeding on fish,\\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the\\n    beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;\\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower\\'d cotton plant, over\\n    the rice in its low moist field,\\nOver the sharp-peak\\'d farm house, with its scallop\\'d scum and\\n    slender shoots from the gutters,\\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav\\'d corn, over the\\n    delicate blue-flower flax,\\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with\\n    the rest,\\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low\\n    scragged limbs,\\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,\\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,\\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\\n    goldbug drops through the dark,\\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to\\n    the meadow,\\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\\n    shuddering of their hides,\\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle\\n    the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,\\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,\\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it\\n    myself and looking composedly down,)\\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\\n    hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\\nWhere the half-burn\\'d brig is riding on unknown currents,\\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\\nWhere the dense-starr\\'d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,\\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,\\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,\\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of\\n    base-ball,\\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\\n    bull-dances, drinking, laughter,\\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the\\n    juice through a straw,\\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;\\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\\n    screams, weeps,\\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are\\n    scatter\\'d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to\\n    the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,\\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,\\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles\\n    far and near,\\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived\\n    swan is curving and winding,\\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her\\n    near-human laugh,\\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the\\n    high weeds,\\nWhere band-neck\\'d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with\\n    their heads out,\\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch\\'d gates of a cemetery,\\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,\\nWhere the yellow-crown\\'d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at\\n    night and feeds upon small crabs,\\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,\\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over\\n    the well,\\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,\\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain\\'d saloon, through the\\n    office or public hall;\\nPleas\\'d with the native and pleas\\'d with the foreign, pleas\\'d with\\n    the new and old,\\nPleas\\'d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\\nPleas\\'d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,\\nPleas\\'d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash\\'d church,\\nPleas\\'d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,\\n    impress\\'d seriously at the camp-meeting;\\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,\\n    flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn\\'d up to the clouds,\\n    or down a lane or along the beach,\\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek\\'d bush-boy, (behind me\\n    he rides at the drape of the day,)\\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals\\' feet, or the\\n    moccasin print,\\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\\nNigh the coffin\\'d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\\n    diameter of eighty thousand miles,\\nSpeeding with tail\\'d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\\nI tread day and night such roads.\\n\\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\\nAnd look at quintillions ripen\\'d and look at quintillions green.\\n\\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\\n\\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\\n\\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\\n\\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\\n    pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\\n\\nI ascend to the foretruck,\\nI take my place late at night in the crow\\'s-nest,\\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\\n    plain in all directions,\\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\\n    fancies toward them,\\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n    be engaged,\\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n    feet and caution,\\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin\\'d city,\\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\\n    of the globe.\\n\\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\\nI turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\\n\\nMy voice is the wife\\'s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\\nThey fetch my man\\'s body up dripping and drown\\'d.\\n\\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\\nThe courage of present times and all times,\\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\\n    steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\\n    days and faithful of nights,\\nAnd chalk\\'d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\\n    not desert you;\\nHow he follow\\'d with them and tack\\'d with them three days and\\n    would not give it up,\\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\\nHow the lank loose-gown\\'d women look\\'d when boated from the\\n    side of their prepared graves,\\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\\n    sharp-lipp\\'d unshaved men;\\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\\nI am the man, I suffer\\'d, I was there.\\n\\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\\nThe mother of old, condemn\\'d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\\n    children gazing on,\\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\\n    blowing, cover\\'d with sweat,\\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\\n    buckshot and the bullets,\\nAll these I feel or am.\\n\\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn\\'d with the\\n    ooze of my skin,\\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\\n\\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n    wounded person,\\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\nI am the mash\\'d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\nThey have clear\\'d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n    of their fire-caps,\\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort\\'s bombardment,\\nI am there again.\\n\\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\\nAgain to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim\\'d shots,\\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n    with his hand,\\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n     34\\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n\\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n    young men.\\n\\nRetreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n    breastworks,\\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n    number, was the price they took in advance,\\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n    seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n    massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\nThe work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\nNone obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n    lay together,\\nThe maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\nSome half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\nThese were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n    came to release him,\\nThe three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n     35\\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\nOur foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n    and never was, and never will be;\\nAlong the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\nMy captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\nWe had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n    killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\nTen o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n    and five feet of water reported,\\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n    to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\nOur frigate takes fire,\\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n    of the fighting.\\n\\nOnly three guns are in use,\\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\nTwo well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n    clear his decks.\\n\\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n    the main-top,\\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\nNot a moment\\'s cease,\\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\nSerene stands the little captain,\\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n     36\\nStretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n    one we have conquer\\'d,\\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n    countenance white as a sheet,\\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n    curl\\'d whiskers,\\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n    upon the masts and spars,\\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n    the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\nThe hiss of the surgeon\\'s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n    dull, tapering groan,\\nThese so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n     37\\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\nIn at the conquer\\'d doors they crowd! I am possess\\'d!\\nEmbody all presences outlaw\\'d or suffering,\\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr\\'d at night.\\n\\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff\\'d to jail but I am handcuff\\'d to him\\n    and walk by his side,\\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n    on my twitching lips.)\\n\\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n    and sentenced.\\n\\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\nMy face is ash-color\\'d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n     38\\nEnough! enough! enough!\\nSomehow I have been stunn\\'d. Stand back!\\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff\\'d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\\nI discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\\n\\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\\n    bludgeons and hammers!\\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\\n    bloody crowning.\\n\\nI remember now,\\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\\n\\nI troop forth replenish\\'d with supreme power, one of an average\\n    unending procession,\\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\\n\\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\\n\\n     39\\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\\n\\nIs he some Southwesterner rais\\'d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\\nIs he from the Mississippi country?

the same as\\n    you mean,\\nGrow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast!\\nSpring away from the conceal\\'d heart there!\\nDo not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!\\nDo not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!\\nCome I am determin\\'d to unbare this broad breast of mine, I have\\n    long enough stifled and choked;\\nEmblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not,\\nI will say what I have to say by itself,\\nI will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a\\n    call only their call,\\nI will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,\\nI will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will\\n    through the States,\\nThrough me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,\\nGive me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,\\nGive me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and\\n    are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,\\nNor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,\\nFor now it is convey\\'d to me that you are the purports essential,\\nThat you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that\\n    they are mainly for you,\\nThat you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,\\nThat behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,\\nThat you will one day perhaps take control of all,\\nThat you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,\\nThat may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,\\nBut you will last very long.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand\\n\\nWhoever you are holding me now in hand,\\nWithout one thing all will be useless,\\nI give you fair warning before you attempt me further,\\nI am not what you supposed, but far different.\\n\\nWho is he that would become my follower?\\nWho would sign himself a candidate for my affections?\\n\\nThe way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,\\nYou would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your\\n    sole and exclusive standard,\\nYour novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,\\nThe whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives\\n    around you would have to be abandon\\'d,\\nTherefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let\\n    go your hand from my shoulders,\\nPut me down and depart on your way.\\n\\nOr else by stealth in some wood for trial,\\nOr back of a rock in the open air,\\n(For in any roof\\'d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,\\nAnd in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)\\nBut just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any\\n    person for miles around approach unawares,\\nOr possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or\\n    some quiet island,\\nHere to put your lips upon mine I permit you,\\nWith the comrade\\'s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband\\'s kiss,\\nFor I am the new husband and I am the comrade.\\n\\nOr if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,\\nWhere I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,\\nCarry me when you go forth over land or sea;\\nFor thus merely touching you is enough, is best,\\nAnd thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.\\n\\nBut these leaves conning you con at peril,\\nFor these leaves and me you will not understand,\\nThey will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will\\n    certainly elude you.\\nEven while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!\\nAlready you see I have escaped from you.\\n\\nFor it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,\\nNor is it by reading it you will acquire it,\\nNor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,\\nNor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few)\\n    prove victorious,\\nNor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil,\\n    perhaps more,\\nFor all is useless without that which you may guess at many times\\n    and not hit, that which I hinted at;\\nTherefore release me and depart on your way.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  For You, O Democracy\\n\\nCome, I will make the continent indissoluble,\\nI will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon,\\nI will make

accumulated,\\n(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and\\n    partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)\\nFar, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I\\n    think where I go,\\nSolitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,\\nAlone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,\\nSome walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,\\nThey the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a\\n    great crowd, and I in the middle,\\nCollecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,\\nPlucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,\\nHere, lilac, with a branch of pine,\\nHere, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull\\'d off a live-oak in\\n    Florida as it hung trailing down,\\nHere, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,\\nAnd here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,\\n(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again\\n    never to separate from me,\\nAnd this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this\\n    calamus-root shall,\\nInterchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)\\nAnd twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,\\nAnd stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,\\nThese I compass\\'d around by a thick cloud of spirits,\\nWandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,\\nIndicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each;\\nBut what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,\\nI will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable\\n    of loving.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  Not Heaving from My Ribb\\'d Breast Only\\n\\nNot heaving from my

them,)\\nMay-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem)\\n    as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they\\n    would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely\\n    changed points of view;\\nTo me these and the like of these are curiously answer\\'d by my\\n    lovers, my dear friends,\\nWhen he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me\\n    by the hand,\\nWhen the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason\\n    hold not, surround us and pervade us,\\nThen I am charged with untold and

over the beach, and undressing bathed,\\n    laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,\\nAnd when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way\\n    coming, O then I was happy,\\nO then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food\\n    nourish\\'d me more, and the beautiful day pass\\'d well,\\nAnd the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came\\n    my friend,\\nAnd that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly\\n    continually up the shores,\\nI heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me\\n    whispering to congratulate me,\\nFor the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in\\n    the cool night,\\nIn the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,\\nAnd his arm

   1\\nAfoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\\nHealthy, free, the world before me,\\nThe long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\\n\\nHenceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\\nHenceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\\nDone with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\\nStrong and content I travel the open road.\\n\\nThe earth, that is sufficient,\\nI do not want the constellations any nearer,\\nI know they are very well where they are,\\nI know they suffice for those who belong to them.\\n\\n(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\\nI carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\\nI swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\\nI am fill\\'d with them, and I will fill them in return.)\\n\\n     2\\nYou road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\\n    that is here,\\nI believe that much unseen is also here.\\n\\nHere the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\\nThe black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas\\'d, the\\n    illiterate person, are not denied;\\nThe birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar\\'s tramp, the\\n    drunkard\\'s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\\nThe escaped youth, the rich person\\'s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\\nThe early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\\n    town, the return back from the town,\\nThey pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\\nNone but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\\n\\n     3\\nYou air that serves me with breath to speak!\\nYou objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\\nYou light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable

at the edges!\\nYou ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\\n    side! you distant ships!\\nYou rows of houses! you window-pierc\\'d facades! you roofs!\\nYou porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\\nYou windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\\nYou doors and ascending steps! you arches!\\nYou gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\\nFrom all that has touch\\'d you I believe you have imparted to\\n    yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\\nFrom the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\\n    and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\\n\\n     4\\nThe earth expanding right hand and left hand,\\nThe picture alive, every part in its best

thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\\nNow if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\\'d it would not\\n    astonish me.\\n\\nNow I see the secret of the making of the best

from one having it to another not having it,\\nWisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\\nApplies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\\nIs the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\\n    excellence of things;\\nSomething there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\\n    it out of the soul.\\n\\nNow I re-examine philosophies and religions,\\nThey may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\\n    spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\\n\\nHere is realization,\\nHere is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\\nThe past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\\n    are vacant of them.\\n\\nOnly the kernel of every object nourishes;\\nWhere is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\\nWhere is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\\n\\nHere is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion\\'d, it is apropos;\\nDo you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\\nDo you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\\n\\n     7\\nHere is the efflux of the soul,\\nThe efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\\'d gates,\\n    ever provoking questions,\\nThese yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\\nWhy are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\\n    expands my blood?\\nWhy when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\\nWhy are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\\n    thoughts descend upon me?\\n(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\\n    drop fruit as I pass;)\\nWhat is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\\nWhat with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\\nWhat with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\\n    and pause?\\nWhat gives me to be free to a woman\\'s and man\\'s good-will? what\\n    gives them to be free to mine?\\n\\n     8\\nThe efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\\nI think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\\nNow it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\\n\\nHere rises the fluid and attaching character,\\nThe fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\\n    man and woman,\\n(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\\n    out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\\n    continually out of itself.)\\n\\nToward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\\n    love of young and old,\\nFrom it falls distill\\'d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\\nToward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\\n\\n     9\\nAllons! whoever you are come

me!\\nOn the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning\\n    home, are more curious to me than you suppose,\\nAnd you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more\\n    to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.\\n\\n     2\\nThe impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,\\nThe simple, compact, well-join\\'d scheme, myself

the walk in the street and the passage over the river,\\nThe current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,\\nThe others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,\\nThe certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.\\n\\nOthers will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,\\nOthers will watch the run of the flood-tide,\\nOthers will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the\\n    heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,\\nOthers will see the islands large and small;\\nFifty years hence, others will see them as they cross,

the big steam-tug closely flank\\'d on\\n    each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\\nOn the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning\\n    high and glaringly into the night,\\nCasting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow\\n    light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\\n\\n     4\\nThese and all else were to me the same as they are to you,\\nI loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,\\nThe men and women I saw were all near to me,\\nOthers the same--others who look back on me

years between us?\\n\\nWhatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,\\nI too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,\\nI too walk\\'d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the\\n    waters around it,\\nI too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\\nIn the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,\\nIn my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,\\nI too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,\\nI too had receiv\\'d identity by my body,\\nThat I was I knew was of my body, and what I should

the old knot of contrariety,\\nBlabb\\'d, blush\\'d, resented, lied, stole, grudg\\'d,\\nHad guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\\nWas wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly,

arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of\\n    their flesh against me as I sat,\\nSaw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet\\n    never told them a word,\\nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\\nPlay\\'d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\\nThe same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\\nOr as small as we like, or both great and small.\\n\\n     7\\nCloser yet I approach you,\\nWhat thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my\\n    stores in advance,\\nI consider\\'d long and seriously of you before you were born.\\n\\nWho was to know what should come home to me?\\nWho knows but I am enjoying this?\\nWho knows, for all the

sunset and scallop-edg\\'d waves of flood-tide?\\nThe sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the\\n    twilight, and the belated lighter?\\nWhat gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I\\n    love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?\\nWhat is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that\\n    looks in my face?\\nWhich fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?\\n\\nWe understand then do we not?\\nWhat I promis\\'d without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\\nWhat the study could not teach--what the

looking upon you;\\nBe firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet\\n    haste with the hasting current;\\nFly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the

one\\'s head, in the sunlit water!\\nCome on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail\\'d\\n    schooners, sloops, lighters!\\nFlaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower\\'d at sunset!\\nBurn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at\\n    nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!\\nAppearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,\\nYou necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,\\nAbout my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,\\nThrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and\\n    sufficient rivers,\\nExpand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,\\nKeep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\\n\\nYou have waited, you always wait,

they spread in the sunshine before me.\\n\\nA young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,\\nHow shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?\\nTell him to send me the signs. And I stand before the young man\\n    face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his\\n    left hand in my right hand,\\nAnd I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that\\n    answers for all, and send these signs.\\n\\nHim all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,\\nHim they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,\\nHim they immerse and he immerses them.\\n\\nBeautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,\\n    people, animals,\\nThe profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so\\n    tell I my morning\\'s romanza,)\\nAll enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,\\nThe best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,\\nThe noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he\\n    domiciles there,\\nNothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,\\n    the ships in the offing,\\nThe perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.\\n\\nHe puts things in their attitudes,\\nHe puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,\\nHe places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and\\n    sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest\\n    never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.\\n\\nHe is the Answerer,\\nWhat can be answer\\'d he answers, and what cannot be answer\\'d he\\n    shows how it cannot be answer\\'d.\\n\\nA man is a summons and challenge,\\n(It is vain to skulk--do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you\\n    hear the ironical echoes?)\\n\\nBooks, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,\\n    beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,\\nHe indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and\\n    down also.\\n\\nWhichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly\\n    and gently and safely by day or by night,\\nHe has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of\\n    hands on the knobs.\\n\\nHis welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or\\n    universal than he is,\\nThe person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.\\n\\nEvery existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,\\nHe resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and\\n    any man translates, and any man translates himself also,\\nOne part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees\\n    how they join.\\n\\nHe says indifferently and alike How are you friend? to the President\\n    at his levee,\\nAnd he says Good-day my brother, to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\\nAnd both understand him and know that his speech is right.\\n\\nHe walks with perfect ease in the capitol,\\nHe walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\\n    Here is our equal appearing and new.\\n\\nThen the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\\nAnd the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that\\n    he has follow\\'d the sea,\\nAnd the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\\nAnd the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,\\nNo matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has\\n    follow\\'d it,\\nNo matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and\\n    sisters there.\\n\\nThe English believe he comes of their English stock,\\nA Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near,\\n    removed from none.\\n\\nWhoever he looks at in the traveler\\'s coffee-house claims him,\\nThe Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard\\n    is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,\\nThe engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi\\n    or St. Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.\\n\\nThe gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,\\nThe insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see\\n    themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,\\nThey are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.\\n\\n     2\\nThe indications and tally of time,\\nPerfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,\\nTime, always without break, indicates itself in parts,\\nWhat always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company\\n    of singers, and their words,\\nThe words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark,\\n    but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,\\nThe maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,\\nHis insight and power encircle things and the human race,\\nHe is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.\\n\\nThe singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,\\nThe singers are welcom\\'d, understood, appear often enough, but rare\\n    has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker\\n    of poems, the Answerer,\\n(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain\\'d such a\\n    day, for all its names.)\\n\\nThe singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible\\n    names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,\\nThe name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,\\n    sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer,\\n    weird-singer, or something else.\\n\\nAll this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\\nThe words of true poems do not merely please,\\nThe true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\\nThe greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\\n    and fathers,\\nThe words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\\n\\nDivine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,\\n    rudeness of body, withdrawnness,\\nGayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.\\n\\nThe sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,\\nThe builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all\\n    these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.\\n\\nThe words of the true poems give you more than poems,\\nThey give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\\n    peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\\nThey balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\\nThey do not seek beauty, they are sought,\\nForever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\\n    fain, love-sick.\\n\\nThey prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\\nThey bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\\nWhom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\\n    learn one of the meanings,\\nTo launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless\\n    rings and never be quiet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n[BOOK X]\\n\\n}  Our Old Feuillage\\n\\nAlways our

love with sweeter spasms than that which\\n    responds love,\\nIt is that which contains itself, which never invites and never refuses.\\n\\nI swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible

with tall shapes dingily seen,\\nThe numerous camp-fires scatter\\'d near and far, some away up on the\\n    mountain,\\nThe shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,\\nAnd over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,\\n    breaking out, the eternal stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  An Army Corps on the March\\n\\nWith its cloud of skirmishers in advance,\\nWith now the

wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,\\nSickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,\\nBy the jamb of a door leans.\\n\\nGrieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks

bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\\nI stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster\\'s face is white as a lily,)\\nThen before I depart I sweep my eyes o\\'er the scene fain to absorb it

O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill\\'d,\\nSome on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the\\n    death-spasm sweating,\\nAn occasional scream or cry, the doctor\\'s shouted orders or calls,\\nThe glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of\\n    the torches,\\nThese I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\\nThen hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;\\nBut first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,\\nThen the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,\\nResuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,\\nThe unknown road still marching.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  A Sight in Camp in the Daybreak Gray and Dim\\n\\nA sight in camp in the

The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.\",\n",

I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.\\r\\nAfter a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).\\r\\nThe parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.\\r\\nAll in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.',\n",

All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.\\r\\nThe rooms were fine.

In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.\\r\\nI did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.\\r\\nNeedless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead!\",\n",

The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example).

TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning. Would stay again if in town.\",\n",

I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.\\r\\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.\\r\\nWould recommend again for a getaway for -, but not for families because of the room size.\",\n",

Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\\r\\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\\r\\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\\r\\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\\r\\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\\r\\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\\r\\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\\r\\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\\r\\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\\r\\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.\",\n",

The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well.

Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! \\r\\nWe didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx --- day and was really worth the money.

       " \"The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. \\r\\n-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\\r\\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\\r\\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\\r\\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\\r\\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \\r\\n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\\r\\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again. Hope the savings were worth it.\",\n",

This is where the good things ended.\\r\\nThe room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages).

To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.\\r\\nI also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening.

After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\\r\\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\\r\\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\\r\\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\\r\\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\\r\\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\\r\\nIf you care to know:\\r\\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week.

The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\\r\\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\\r\\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it.

The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in.

The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS.

The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well.

We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\\r\\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. \\r\\nOverall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.\",\n",

       " 'My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value.

They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn\\'t have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn\\'t my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\\r\\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night\\'s rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn\\'t able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.',\n",

Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath.

The next morning I spoke with a very pleasant rep “Angela” at the front desk I explain the situation of the parking and AAA, she begins by apologizing she tells me how the discount works which is not how I was told over the phone the -nd time; I was unable to get the AAA discount but I did get - days of free parking worth $-- a day and a bottle of wine for my birthday which I was very satisfied with.

Breakfast was usually hot, and there was always enough food out. There is a Manager's Reception each Monday-Thursday night like at all Homewood's, but I did not attend one of those so I can't comment on the quality. The rooms are awesome. I was fortunate enough to be able to book a fireplace suite. They provide you one firelog for free, but any remaining logs you must buy yourself. They do sell them at the front desk, but if you are going to use more than - I would simply buy them from the nearby Target or Walmart for cheaper. The suite was very spacious. The bedroom itself is the size of your common hotel room. The living area have both a semi-comfortable chair, and a not so comfortable at all couch. The kitchens are equipped with a stove top and microwave, but there is no oven which I find to be a negative. At the very least, a convection oven combined with the microwave would be nice. You will not have a problem finding a place to store your luggage as there are plenty of closets and two sets of drawers. My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper. My room was in the Southeast corner of the property (the absolute worst place) so I could actually feel the floors shake when the trains went by. Luckily I am not a light sleeper. As far as location, it is a short drive to several restaurants and a great shopping mall. Of course, not all business travelers have the luxury of a rental car so it is nice to be able to walk to restaurants. Well, that will not happen if you stay here. However, they do provide a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a - mile radius. I did not use the shuttle, so I can't comment on how convenient it is. Overall, this is definitely an excellent place to stay for the price. If you are familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, this property will not disappoint. Just stay away from the South and East side of the property and you will have nothing to complain about.\",\n",

They have a nice property, but to advertise it as a Four Star Hotel is misleading. I would have to compare it to a Springhill Suite or Holiday Inn Express just without a Concierge.

I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. \\r\\nA couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.\\r\\nThe other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. \\r\\nAlso, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise.

They said they try to give preference on the best rooms to people who book directly through them or their website. And we got there shortly after check-in. In any case, it exceeded all expectations in terms of service, cleanliness, and comfort. Great central location, amazing value.\",\n",

       " 'My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. \\r\\nThe hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I\\'m sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.\\r\\nThe service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.\\r\\nThe room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --\\'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.\\r\\nThe pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"raised\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. \\r\\nThe presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.\\r\\nOverall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it\\'s my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.',\n",

Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). \\r\\nBUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:\\r\\nWe were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.\\r\\nSaturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. \\r\\nI suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don\\'t know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue.

I was disappointed when I opened a cabinet door that looked like it would contain a refrigerator and there was just a giant cabinet. The room did have a -- inch flat screen TV…definitely not HD. Although, the Marriott website advertises that all rooms have HBO, this channel did not come through on our TV. \\r\\nMy biggest surprise was how many families were staying at the hotel (maybe due to the proximity to the zoo). I would highly recommend that the Marriott put families and business travelers on different floors, as families tend to be noisier and be awake at different hours than business travelers.

The menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches, and it's all made to order, to eat right there or take up to the room. We had tomato soup and turkey sandwich, it was fresh and delicious.

But the main issue for me was it is very difficult signing up to use internet access if you do not have a credit card billed to a US Address. The hotel uses T Mobile for internet access and it took two days dealing with T Mobile to solve this problem (and two months after returning home to cancel the continuing debits). The hotel staff were no help - they continued to transfer me to the same TMobile number. Many business guests (me included) make their choice of hotel dependent on high-speed internet access being readily available in the room. Additionally, it was very expensive especially since most hotels I stay in at this level provide free access.',\n",

The check-in was smooth and easy, but the real 'wow' moment was when we walked into our room, I thought we had been upgraded to a suite as the room was huge! It's not your normal hotel room... It reminded me of a cool loft apartment, exposed brick walls and bare ceilings and floors (sounds horrible but trust me it's amazing) very modern decor, huge flat screen TV on the wall, a sofa, art on the walls, - huge double beds with clean white linens, fantastic view of Dallas, I could go on and on. Very nice concept for a hotel room. Huge shower and a separate toilet area. Lots of space to hang clothes and hide suitcases. Free wi-fi in the rooms, I could have easily stayed in the room for my whole stay! The hotel it's self is just as good as the rooms, modern and lots of art everywhere, the rooftop pool was fantastic and the bar was great for having a few cocktails. There didn't seem to be many guests staying here so we felt like we had a lot of space and it felt really exclusive. Across the street there is a great restaurant-bar called the Cedar Social, I would recommend making a reservation as it was so busy in there but I can see why as the food was amazing, and across the other street there was a really nice coffee shop which was also a bar in the evening.

They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all.

From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They pointed out all the best places to watch the -th July fireworks from, and provided us with a map of how to get around. Our room was small but more than adequate. The furnishings were luxurious, and everything immaculate. We both slept well, and never even heard another sole all night. Unfortunately we didnt get the chance to sample the delights of the restaurant, but from the outside it looked like the perfect place for a romantic meal. What we did find very useful was the business centre which was free of charge and open --hrs. All in all we couldn't fault the place. The location is perfect. We walked easily to the Space Needle & Lake Union. Pike Place Market was no more than a -- minute walk, and the shops were just a stopnes throw away. This hotel is a must!\",\n",

I was worried about noise, but they weren\\'t noisy. However, I strongly suspect this used to be a different kind of hotel - it just didn\\'t have that La Quinta feel at ALL. It\\'s easily the worst La Quinta I\\'ve ever stayed in.\\r\\nOur air conditioner struggled to cool the room (and it wasn\\'t even full-on Florida heat outside) and we woke up to the feeling of dew everywhere in the morning. A major purpose of AC in Florida is to pull the moisture out of the air. The front grill of the AC kept falling open, too.\\r\\nThere was a mysterious small hole in the light switch in the toilet-bath room, which lined up with the front of the shower.

       " \"It was my first visit to USA and also my first time at a St. Regis. The hotel is in an excellent location, just two blocks or so from the famous White House. and in the proximity of most of the attrations the city has to offer. We were upgraded to a suite which was a large room complete witha well-equipped bathroom. The room could have been better configured to be divided in two offering a bit more privacy. I particularly liked the soft material of the bathrobe. Not the usual thick toweling but soft silky material. The large mirror on the wall in the bathroom also included a TV very convenient whilst soaking in the tub. The hotel has one restaurant. The Adour by Alain Ducas. Whilst this is an excellent one, it would have been nice to have a less sophisticated place for lunch and dinner on premises. However, the hotel is surrounded by very good restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. One of the family favourites is Mcormick and Schmick's a few meters away from the St. Regis. The reception staff at the hotel were not always that keen on smiling, although the doormen always offered their help be it with opening the heavy doors or calling a cab. This being the St. Regis, there is no buffet breakfast included in the room rate. Breakfast is a la carte and may add up to quite a bit at the end of the stay. Quality is excellent, and so is the service offered by waiting staff. Back in Washington DC I would go back to this hotel.\",\n",

       " \"I would definitely stay at Chicago's House of Blues Hotel again, despite a few 'caveat emptor' notes. First, they gave away our room the first of three nights. However, they put us up in the nearby, fancy Ritz-Carlton (a far superior but boring luxury hotel), even giving us cab fare to and from the Ritz. Why did this happen? 'A group came in,' the unsmiling young clerk said, as though bracing for a tirade. \\r\\nThinking maybe it was a group of groupies for some band playing at the HOB next door, we didn't protest much. I suspected it also had to do with the fact that we booked through Expedia, but can't substantiate that. Expedia was great. After paying in advance and having Expedia alert the hotel in writing that we were arriving late and us calling the hotel directly that afternoon from the east coast to confirm ('yes, we have your reservation'), it sucked coming from the airport and being summarily told there was no room. But points to the HOB for putting us up at the Ritz-Carlton (which failed to give us the requested roll-away cot when they didn't have a room with two beds for two straight guys so one of us slept on the floor on a bedspread at the Ritz after coming in at - a.m. but that's another story). Anyway, next morning, we called the HOB to tell them we were coming over for our room. 'Yes, sir, we have three rooms with twin beds.' Only problem was, -- minutes later, the front desk tried to tell us there were no such rooms. Persistence paid off, and we soon found ourselves in a nice, spacious room on the --th floor. Everything else about the HOB hotel was good. In fact, they wanted to comp us with a Junior Suite after the trouble we were put through, but it didn't have two beds. Points for HOB Hotel. We liked the room decorations and colors, although the voodoo motif might have scared the heck out of kids or a sleepwalker. The room had a great view and floor-to-ceiling windows that actually opened! Excellent air-conditioning. The bathroom was outstanding, as was the maid service. Night-owls will like the opague curtains. The towels were thin, but the shower fine. Doors were solid and elevators efficient. \\r\\nThe place seemed new and was very clean. No hookers seemed to be hanging around, although there was plentiful scenery in this chic location. The TV reception was poor and number of cable channels small. \\r\\nBut we didn't go to watch TV so didn't matter. They give you a compiliation blues CD. Rooms have a good little stereo system, so bring your own CDs. The room was spacious, with a desk chair, but no lounge chairs. Nice hassock, though. The downstairs bar, which just won a Chicago magazine poll for best hotel bar, was dead as a doornail Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. But the adjacent House of Blues restaurant-concert hall was hopping. The HOB location is great, just over the Chicago River from the Loop subway stops, meaning you can take a subway from either O'Hare or Midway and walk to the hotel if you're traveling pretty lightly. The river itself is dwarfed by majestic architecture and topped by multiple picturesque bridges, a few blocks away from the site of the ---- Eastland ship disaster that killed --- people (plaque marks the site for history buffs). Besides a friendly Smith & Wollensky next door overlooking the river, the general area is kind of beautiful but kind of dead, so hop on the Red Line to Wrigleyville or just about anywhere in the city (we got a three-day $-- subway-bus pass that we wore out). Back to the hotel--the lobby looks like something out of Marrakesh; this is not your average expensive hotel, perhaps an acquired taste, but I would definitely stay there again. Staff was pretty friendly, location is bedrock Chicago, subway right nearby, and you might get a break on the price through Expedia or other on-line broker; our average cost for Saturday-Sunday-Monday was about $---. And we brought the dress code a bit down to earth at the Ritz in the process!\",\n",

To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It\\'s about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out. \\r\\nThere are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren\\'t a problem.\\r\\nThere is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before. \\r\\nNow to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can\\'t EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"superior\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don\\'t get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice. \\r\\nRoom service which we didn\\'t use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield\\'s to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"snack\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" type chips.

OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield\\'s and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!! \\r\\nJust remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it\\'s not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don\\'t think that we would stay here again as I\\'m sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first. Don\\'t be fooled by the name or the look.

I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you\\'re cramping their style.

In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don\\'t they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.\\r\\nThe first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn\\'t correct the problems! We gave up.

We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It\\'s a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don\\'t think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I\\'d avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff\\'s CD\\'s. Wwhhhhaaat??? \\r\\nFor a good restaurant, try Petterino\\'s, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray\\'s. There\\'s also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.\\r\\nLastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It\\'s a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on -- and then -- is hideous!

Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What\\'s next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.\\r\\nWe did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We\\'re sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)\\r\\nThere are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago.

However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal\\r\\nof it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged. \\r\\nWe are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making\\r\\nit hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors. \\r\\nAs other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $--.-- plus tax per day ... and parking is $--! So, a relatively inexpensive\\r\\nroom rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises\\r\\nrapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.\\r\\nThe other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.\\r\\nOn the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon\\r\\nrequest - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.\\r\\nIn summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure? \\r\\nIn all honesty, I probably would not return.

Dont pay for the cheapest room, its a -* hotel so naturally if you pay for the cheapest room it will be the smallest and have a poor view, so if you can afford to stay here, make sure you pay a bit extra. There are lots of categories of rooms and two wings to stay in so do a bit of research before booking. Dont not stay here because of the people who complain about the price of food etc, of course its expensive, its a -* hotel, but when in San Francisco why eat-drink away your money in the hotel? There are many great places a few mins walk out the door that offer just as good food for half the price. When I asked the concierge for recommendations on where to eat, he never mentioned their own restaurants which goes to show they do care about your experience in the city as a whole, not just how much you spend at the hotel. There are a lot of reviews that complain about how busy it is, that is never a bad thing.

       " 'Marriott LAX - --.--.--\\r\\n This is a typical large Marriott hotel with all the services you expect. It is very close to the airport terminals, but current arrangements with airport shuttles mean it may take longer to reach the hotel door than you would like. This, plus new LAX security policy, which apparently prohibits walking to and from the area, means that even though you are literally next to the airport, you should plan on more time to get to your room or meeting than you would have in the past.\\r\\n Otherwise, we experienced no problems with this property. \\r\\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are alarmingly small for such a hotel, reminding one of some of the old New York City hotels that were converted from really old properties but kept the small room sizes. Given prices near the airport, it might pay to shop around for a hotel with more living space if you are going to spend more than a night there. Within a quarter mile of the terminals, there are lots of top hotels to choose from.\\r\\n If you are not a frequent visitor to LAX, you should also prepare yourself for the airport’s abysmal conditions and expect it to take you maybe twice as long to negotiate outbound departures. Security procedures are closer to those in third world airports and the domestic and international terminal areas are well behind those in some other major USA airports and disorganized, despite the waves of TSA (read as “Thousands Standing Around”), personnel shuttling your checked baggage from one place to another. The absurdity of the three stage international departure exercise challenges both logic and patience as you must first check in with the airline, then physically carry your checked baggage to the TSA X-Ray point which is always backed up and understaffed, then go and get in line a third time for the usual mindless check of your carry-on and person. This routine may also include undue harassment from private security personnel at various locations. \\r\\n Plan at least three hours for portal to portal, hotel front door to airline gate, to be safe. \\r\\n Still, the hotel is convenient if you must be in or go through LAX and sometimes you have little choice. If you arrive there from overseas, prepare yourself for long waits, first at immigration and then at customs. Returning from Japan, we spent two hours after we got our luggage getting through US government check points. Private security personnel were the rudest encountered in many years anywhere, so again, prepare yourself for “The LAX Treatment.” \\r\\n As other reviews show, there is no convenient place to eat except at other nearby hotels, so plan accordingly. Food and beverage inside the hotel was acceptable, but nothing outstanding or memorable.\\r\\n Because of hotel chain loyalty, I would go back there again, assuming I got a competitive rate, but my future planning will try to avoid LAX altogether.',\n",

By this time staff had lied to me twice, about the move to the 'bigger' room the previous day, and about a suite being available today.

This suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel, and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction.\\r\\nAs a frequent business and leisure traveler I have never before experienced such a terrible product, or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction. I the attitude of the (female) duty manager on the morning of Saturday - June was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and I cannot understand how on earth she was ever given a position of responsibility. \\r\\n Luckily we moved to the Hudson hotel, which for a similar room rate was in a totally different league, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.

The coffee maker could not have been used to boil water for tea without it being coffee-tainted. The tv didn't have a lot of channels and the digital signal froze now-and-again but you could get news, weather, a film or cartoons for the children.

I don't think we could have made a better choice. Upon check-in, the receptionist, Israel, told us we had an upgraded room, which was amazing, and was kind enough to provide a map and recommend some local places with great food. (Highlights were Thornton's for breakfast on a sunny morning and Trident Bookseller's & Cafe, where you must try the mushroom-fig sandwich.)\\r\\nWe knew we didn't need five-star luxury, just a place to sleep, but were pleasantly surprised by a hotel that is clean, relaxing, and has very comfortable beds. The yellow hallways give the hotel a happy vibe, and the bathrooms are done in white tile that didn't have me questioning the cleanliness. The hotel has free WiFi, unlike some other local hotels that charge you. We had breakfast in the cafeteria downstairs and were happy with the good price and convenience.\\r\\nThe hotel is about --- feet from Back Bay Station on the Orange line, which was very convenient for taking Amtrak in, and about a quarter mile from Copley on the Green line. This made getting back very easy, even with unpleasant winter weather. The hotel is very close to Newbury Street, Trinity Church, and the Boston Public Library and within easy walking distance of the Prudential Center, Museum of Fine Arts, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, all of which I would recommend visiting.

Booked the hotel through hotwire, so it was a reasonable price. \\r\\nThe grounds and facilities are decent enough, check-in was pretty smooth and there were no major complaints. However, the hotel is a fair distance away from the interstate. Keep that in mind if you're staying for just a night or passing through. If you're staying for a few days and playing golf, the proximity of the interstate probably isn't a big deal. In addition to being a distance away from the interstate, the place was a little difficult to locate, its behind some small farms, etc., and not in a place where you'd expect to find a hotel. \\r\\nAside from the location, this place wasn't really anything special. The decor was a little dated and cheesy looking, and you can tell its a timeshare golf condo rather than a hotel room. We didn't use any of the kitchen facilities since we were just staying for a night. They were installing something in the room next to ours and there was some noise from drilling and hammering while we were staying there, which was fortunately not during hours when we were sleeping. Also our doorbell was randomly rang at - AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that. \\r\\nAll in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special.

The bed was not their heavenly bed as we expected and expect from Westin. I suspect they either substituted a cheaper replacement or something because it was horrible. We were close to street and the noise was enough to drive you crazy, I don't know where it all came from but we heard kids and adults carrying on till the wee hours. The room A-C control is one of those fake controls, you can't change the temp and it wouldn't matter if you tried, you will get what they want you to have.

       " 'I like the Hilton brand hotels and stay frequently. Booked the brand new HGI Inner Harbor for a weekend family getaway. I was delighted but disappointed all in the same trip. The pros - the hotel is brand new and the location is fabulous - close to all inner harbor attractions. Since the hotel is new, it is very very clean (spotless actually) and the rooms are modern and cozy. They are a little small, but I find that common with any big city hotel. But overall, I was satisified w- the accomodations. We had a room on the --th floor (top floor) with a nice view of the inner harbor. The odd # rooms face towards the harbor-city. The cons are that because the hotel was new, I think the staff was too. Service can use a Hilton make over. Check in was very slow. The clerk seemed genuinely unwelcoming and uninterested that I chose his hotel to stay in. He provided no information and barely made eye contact. The hotel is co-located w- the Homewood Suites by Hilton so be careful to go to the correct desk & elevators. Homewood clerks had no action but stood at their stations staring at - of us in line to check in to the HGI without offering any of us assistance. When I got to my room the card keys didn\\'t work and my wife had to keep my three small children out in the hall while I went back down to rectify the problem. I barely got an apology and was told I probably put them next to my cell phone (meanwhile my cell was in my bag on the baggage cart so it was impossible for that to have happened). I told the guy that wasn\\'t the case and he just handed me my keys and said \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"here you go.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Not Hilton-esque service!

No offer to bring one up to us.\\r\\nTo access the pool, you need a separate pass to the health club (non Hilton facility in the same building, but guests can get in with a pass and photo ID ). Ask at check in b-c they don\\'t tell you about it when you do check in. Also, you should inquire about parking so you can get an in-out access card - again you aren\\'t told by the staff, you have to ask for everyting. It\\'s $-- but that is actually a bargain for the area especially with in-out priveleges. Main attractions are in walking distance anyway.\\r\\nAte breakfast at the Great American grill. Food was good but very slow at the counter - they cook to order eggs, pancakes, etc.. There was a wedding party so that may have contributed. Restaturant staff was friendly and helpful, but again, you could tell the hotel was new in operation and all parts weren\\'t moving in the same directions quite yet.

       " 'When we made arrangements to attend a function at the nearby Smart Center, the business manager suggested this hotel as convenient to their location (and all the other dealerships on --th). It was also very reasonably priced. So I called to verify vacancies for the date we would need a room, and the room rate. I was disappointed to hear that there were no king sized beds- (so we booked a full-queen), and there was no room service available. I was pleased that the room rate was so low (I haven\\'t stayed in a hotel for less than $-- since people were break dancing in parachute pants!) and I was happy to hear that there was a pizza place that delivered to the hotel and there were several nice restaurants nearby, so I made the reservation.\\r\\nA few days later, I realized I had not received my confirmation email. So, to be \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"on the safe side\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" (read, because my other half insisted), I called to make sure we had a room reserved. It was a good thing I did (read, yes, she was right) because there was no record of my reservation in their computer, and we did not have a room reserved, despite my phone reservation. The hotel manager was apologetic, and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation.\\r\\nThe night we checked in, the GPS eventually got us to the hotel, but using the GPS we had to drive through a residential subdivision. Ordinarily, this would not be a big deal, but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that I have ever seen. Seriously, who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high? Who needs speed bumps a foot high every -- feet for a quarter of a mile? After slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump, and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell, I decided to turn back and find an alternate route. The GPS found one- by going only one block further, and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot- without any speed bumps... \\r\\nWe arrived at --:--pm (we had changed time zones on the drive), and the clerk quickly got us checked in. We were disappointed to learn however, that all of the nearby restaurants, bar and grill places, even the fast food joints, cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result, all of them, and I mean all of them, closed at - or --pm. Because it was a week night, even the pizza place closed early. In short, there are only - places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after --pm- Mc D\\'s, or BurgerK. So, after hours of driving, we had to get back in the car and head out for a paper sack full of drive-thru, deep fried, greasy grub, and a couple of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"cokes.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\r\\nAs for the room, the room itself was small, but not as small as some of the hotel rooms I\\'ve stayed in, our room was probably around -- x --. The kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces. There is not enough room for a sofa, but there was a recliner parked in the corner. There was nothing in the room that wasn\\'t functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty. The ac appeared to be newer, and worked fine. The room was very clean, but appeared somewhat dated. We did not use the appliances, except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker- both of which worked fine (the coffee was awful however-bring your own if you can). The bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower. The water pressure was good, and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing. Oddly, there was no shampoo in the shower, and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo. Maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the McD\\'s drive thru?... The bed was very firm (I had no problem, but the wife didn\\'t sleep well because it was too firm for her). The pillows were the typical synthetic, non-allergic spun polyester type (which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee) but if you use just one pillow, your head will sink to the mattress, (which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers...)\\r\\nThe next morning, We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty, and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room. With the exception of the repeated, high pitched, angry screaming and squeals of someone\\'s precious little darling outside our door \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"No!, I want the ...(something or other)\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" as we packed up to check out, we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway. So noise was generally not a problem.\\r\\nCheckout was easy, and took all of twenty seconds. We were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there. We probably will not stay there again, because we honestly don\\'t really have a reason to return to the area. I think for a business professional who doesn\\'t have an expense account, and isn\\'t reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however, it would be a good, inexpensive option, as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before -pm, you double check your reservation, bring your own pillow, coffee and shampoo and you don\\'t expect the four seasons or the fairmont for $--.',\n",

In the room there's a TV with Fox, NBC, CNN, Weather Channel and some other channels, there's a coffee machine next to the TV, a hairdryer in the bathroom.

The spa was terrible, I booked my trip with the spa manager and it was poorly planned for by the manager, The massage therapist called in sick on one of my friends treatments and they called my home phone to let us know she could get a facial instead. an hour and a half before the treatment ( We never got the call since we had a - hour drive to san diego and we were already at the hotel . They did not offer discount or anything for the inconvenience until we complained to a manager I was handed toilet paper to put in the bathroom myself. We had to use the mens locker room because there wasn't enough room in the women's locker room. The treatments were less than mediocre for the price that it is I expected more! The pool was newly renovated and we were promised that it would be open and it was closed for - hours which was during the time period that we were able to use it cause we had our spa treatments when it was supposed to open.Then the security at the club was extremely rude and lied about his name when we asked him. We paid money to stay in a very nice hotel and expected to be treated a whole lot better than we were. When we called a manager to complain about the security we were told that there are - sides to the story and given a complimentary drink to solve the problem and my friend was stating that this is the worst hotel she's ever stayed at and another lady walking by said I agree.The staff was unfriendly with the exception of the bell service. The worst part is after the whole experience I complained to the manager and all he could do is send me a form letter and offer an upgrade if I choose to return. When I complained about the form letter all he can say is sorry you feel that way. Talk about poor customer service! I will make it my goal to let everyone know that this was The Worst Hotel I've Ever stayed at and worst customer service I have ever had.\",\n",

       " \"Why I'm rating this hotel as one star is not that it truly deserves one star. It's to make up for all the people that mistakenly have given it such good reviews. The truth is that it's a two star motel with pretensions of being a three star motel but with some serious one star failings. My feeling is that at a three star motel you should feel safe and comfortable. The rooms were noisy. The second floor rooms shook as people walked by outside because of a walkway with a cantilevered design. The heating units were of an older type which means they were hard to control and noisy too boot. The beds were too high (sitting on the bed my feet did not touch the floor) and too soft. Now, as far as safety was concerned, I have some serious doubts about gas stoves in a motel. In addition the location of the motel was in a slightly dicey neighborhood.\\r\\nNote, this motel is not very conveniently located if you are a tourist and there are also not all that many good places to eat nearby. The exception is the small Lebanese restaurant directly across the street which is quite authentic and worth a visit.\",\n",
       " 'There\\'s a lot of positive things about this place.\\r\\n First is location -- it\\'s extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well. There is also a Trader Joes and Vons within less than a half mile -- almost walking distance. The location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful, with bayfront-estuary views and a huge walking-biking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too. Its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off, because of the proximity to the airport. \\r\\n The rooms have a nice almost full kitchen -- full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, - burner range and no oven. There is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with - chairs in our one bedroom unit. There\\'s a nice little balcony with one chair on it -- for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine. There are two LG flatscreen TVs -- one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate. The fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression, but it was still comfortable. There\\'s a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable. The bed linens are soft and comfortable, there are a wide variety of pillows available. The toilet paper is Cottonelle -- so it\\'s nice and soft, not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now, and the toiletries are very nice Neutrogena products. \\r\\n The business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes. The laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job. My husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights and a weight machine - drinking fountains and a TV were available in the workout room. \\r\\nThe gardens and outdoor areas were extensive, well landscaped and maintained.. There was quite a variety of outdoor seating available, with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas. There were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern, clean and ready to go. \\r\\nThe breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate - but not gourmet. You get hot filling food, but it\\'s just kind of average. Standard make your own waffles, bagels, english muffins, etc, - three \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hot offerings\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" which usually are eggs, sausage and tater tots -- the best of which is the tater tots, and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches, canned mandarins, cottage cheese and yogurt, and some fresh melon chunks. Evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar, and a hot offering that has been during our stay - edible, but mostly because it\\'s included. There\\'s drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area, it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day. \\r\\nI found the staff to be friendly and responsive, even when our flight was delayed. The cleaning staff is polite, unobtrusive and efficient.\\r\\nThe hotel offers very good rates, with nice discounts for government and AAA and they participate in the HH points program. It is a family oriented hotel, so there will be kids at breakfast, in the pool, etc.... and, of course, their behavior is up to their parents ... but we had no problem with noise. \\r\\nOverall - the best place to stay in SanDiego if you\\'re not looking for night life, excitement etc. If you want a great convenient location, nice facilities, large room, kitchen facilities, and the open air experience -- with just a few minutes to the zoo, SeaWorld, Balboa park, airport and downtown -- no parking fees, no internet fees, and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around.... This one\\'s got it!!!',\n",

The coffees and snacks throughout the day and evening are a wonderful way to recharge after a busy schedule. However, the evening wine and cheese reception cannot be beat. It was so nice to relax and sip some sparkling wine before heading out to face the chaos of Times Square. Our room was a nice size (- double beds) but some of the rooms did look extremely small.

After staying here for one night, while attending a wedding onsite, I\\'ll have to say I think management should focus more on being a hotel and less on being an experience.\\r\\nThe positive things about the hotel are evident from the website. The rooms are unique, the modern decoration is attractive, and the location is fantastic. I attended a wedding reception, which used the roof bar for cocktail hour, and the views are simply amazing. It\\'s a very hip, fun place to hang out.\\r\\nBut, I really can\\'t recommend spending your money to sleep here. To start, there was a parade going on downtown, and we could not navigate the streets to get to the hotel. We called the front desk to ask for directions, and for help on where to park since the parking entrance was blocked by the parade. The front desk literally knew nothing. Despite the fact that the parade was marching by their front door, no one had any information about the route, or timing, or how to park at the hotel during this time. We finally had a friend drop us about a half mile from the hotel, and we walked over to discuss in person how he could drive up. They acted just as clueless in person as they had on the phone. Friend ended up parking elsewhere and walking over.\\r\\nSecond, after the wedding reception ended, the bride invited the group to the rooftop bar to continue the party. What we were not told, by hotel management, is that after a certain hour only one elevator takes you to the roof, so we would have to go downstairs, go outside, wait in line, get a wrist band, then take the elevator back upstairs. Not realizing this, myself and a few others went in to the stairwell from the floor we were on for dinner to walk up to the roof. There was a bouncer at the door who would not let us in, which is annoying to begin with, but that alone wouldn\\'t make me complain. However what was simply unbelievable is that he would not escort us to the elevator to let us out, and instead left us LOCKED in the stairwell on the top floor! None of the doors on other floors opened, until the ground floor. And, I was wearing heels. He would not call anyone to come let us in, even after we begged and explained that we were hotel guests trying to get to our room, he simply told us we had to leave and walk all the way down. We started banging on the doors at each floor, and a hotel patron heard us and opened from the inside and let us in. Needless to say I did not bother trying to get back to the club.\\r\\nBack in our room, which was on a middle floor, closer to the top than bottom, to add insult to inury we could hear the music from the club while we tried to sleep! My friend was on a floor above us and said it was so loud she couldn\\'t sleep at all. It wasn\\'t awful where I was, but definitely you could still hear it.\\r\\nSo, overall, this is a nice place to visit, but service is lacking, and for most people it\\'s not the best place to rest your head. Look elsewhere to spend your dollars.',\n",

Another on site restaurant is the Cibolo Moon which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we ate there on a few occassions and must say it was also very good. I also thought the prices were fair for the type of property the resort is. \\r\\nThe only draw back to staying at this property is that you need a car as there is nothing within walking distance so therefore yo have to drive.

       " \"I've stayed in at least a dozen hotels in San Francisco within walking distance of the Palomar. Most cost a little less. For me, the slightly higher rate for the Palomar was worth it. \\r\\nIt's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp--player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening.\\r\\nThe location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes.\\r\\nI was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all. I The doorman always wished me a nice day and asked if I wanted transportation, but he was never pushy. The room was cleaned unobtrusively. These are all things we should expect, but just don't always happen, so when everything works, I think it's worth mentioning.\\r\\nA few details: The hotel is pet friendly.

Every time the reception staff called a cab for me, it would not be a legally registered cab with taximeter. It was a guy with his personal car charging flat rates. My room itself was reasonable, the only problem was a mild cigarette odor in the carpet. What is really terrible, actually, is the bad neighborhood where the hotel is. One morning when I was there, five days ago, one of the guests had his car window broken and some of his stuff was stolen during the night.

       " 'For all those fellow travelers who are tired of airports and the eternal stresses that have developed around simply taking a plane ride, you will find tremendous solace in a small island of tranquility at the Grand Hyatt DFW Airport.\\r\\nOn a recent trip to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico, we were traveling through DFW from Washington DC. Due to forecasted snow on our day of departure, American Airlines cancelled our outbound flight and they re-booked us so that we over-nighted, at our expense though, in Dallas in order to catch the one-day-a-week flight to Ixtapa.\\r\\nYou should note that there are two Hyatt hotels at DFW. In terminal C is the Hyatt Regency DFW and in terminal D is the Grand Hyatt. We decided to choose the Grand Hyatt given that our plane was due to leave from this very same terminal. To our surprise, the Grand Hyatt is a stunning hotel even superior to any city hotel in which we have stayed let along the reputation of “airport” hotels.\\r\\nIn the event that you arrive at any other terminal, there are regular (free) airport shuttles that will take you to the Grand Hyatt in terminal D. For starters, once one collects their bags in terminal D, it is a very easy walk and an escalator ride to the elevators to the Hyatt. What struck me as we approached the hotel elevators was that the American Airlines check-in (for our following day departure) could not have been more than -- steps away with the security area literally adjacent to it. Nothing like rolling out of bed and checking-in for your flight!\\r\\nExiting the hotel elevator, you will be presented with a well appointed lobby to your left and to your right a very attractive bar and restaurant. This hotel also offers conference facilities that are rather impressive. Our west facing room was a suite on the sixth floor that was spacious with a living room and very large bedroom. The décor is modern and minimalist with a very fancy lighting and (electric) blind-curtain system. The standard amenities are all included. Yet, a peculiarity was noted that we never experienced: you have to call the reception so that they can deliver a coffee maker-pot for the room. This is very odd. Although the rooms are well insulated and may be stating the obvious, you will hear some noise of the departing aircrafts even if they may not be using the runways in front of terminal D. Yet, traffic subsides significantly after --pm. \\r\\nA quick tour of the property is worth it not just to familiarize oneself, but to appreciate the many amenities. Aside from the expansive conference facilities and business center, it has a very good fitness center, outdoor pool and sun deck. Features that I am sure would come in handy when staying during warmer months. The restaurant is very large and attractive. We have a very tasty breakfast the following morning.\\r\\nThis hotel was a great stress reliever due to our initial tempestuous departure and it reset the tone for our one week vacation.',\n",

From the moment I arrived when the valet picked up my car, to the moment I departed when the valet returned my car, I experienced nothing but great customer service from Omni's staff. A first I was skeptical, thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms, but when I opened the door to my room, I found it to be clean, comfortable and modern. No dust or crumbs around the baseboards. The mattress was high and firm. The sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. The bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. I also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. Most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. The fitness center at the Omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. The free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what I expected. Further, the Omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! I definitely recommend the Omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.\",\n",

       " 'Loved the hotel and its location! We\\'re a family of six, and picking a hotel is always a delicate balancing act. We need enough room where we don\\'t drive each other crazy but it also needs to be relatively affordable. The Affinia Dumont was perfect for our --night holiday stay in NYC. We had a --bedroom skyline suite with - queen beds in the bedroom and a pull-out sofa in the living room. Beautiful view of the city, including the Chrysler Building. \\r\\nThe suite had a roomy foyer-like area at its entry-way which was great for the keeping of our shoes and boots. There was also a really nice dresser - closet - dressing area in the bedroom area outside of the bathroom that was great for keeping our suitcases, dirty clothes, and collection of jackets out of our way. \\r\\nThe kitchen was set off in a little room by itself, which I really liked. It was very small but had everything you could need - full size refrigerator, toaster, microwave, decent-size sink, coffee maker, gas (!!) stovetop with oven, dishwasher, and lots of drawer and cupboard space. It was also stocked with silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, a couple of pots, and a frying pan. There was service for four and we needed more; we requested more and they quickly stocked it with service for six for us. \\r\\nThe bathroom was surprisingly roomy and had plenty of shelf space for all our things - a typical one over the sink area and then another deep one on another wall. Water pressure in the shower was good, but like in a lot of hotels, the water fluctuated between very, very cool and very, very warm.\\r\\nThe staff were all particularly competent and friendly - from before our trip down right through the time we (sadly) had to leave. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the bellman (Donald, I believe) was super welcoming and helpful. The front desk manager David was very helpful in planning our stay, and housekeeping did a great job every day.\\r\\nWe fully utilized a number of the hotel\\'s offerings - kitchen (in its entirety!), the pillow menu, the bathrobes, the telescope (requested with the skyline suite), the DVD player (that was brought up within ~- minutes of our request!), the steam shower, the fitness room, the strengthening kit - and truly appreciated them. I booked the room through the Affinia website and had a lot of fun with their My Affinia - My Concierge.\\r\\nThe hotel has recently been renovated, and they did a terrific job. Everything was very nice and tastefully done. Both rooms had large flat-screen TVs. Beds were very comfortable, and down pillows were plentiful. We were on the --th floor and had no problems whatsoever with the elevators. We found them to be quite speedy - both in arrival time and travel time. Lobby is relatively small but inviting and seemingly comfortable - there were always people in it on their computers. We didn\\'t use it, so I can\\'t say how the internet service is.\\r\\nThe Murray Hill location is a joy. In the past, we\\'ve tended to stay in the Theater District, but I greatly preferred staying in Murray Hill. I like that it has more of a neighborhood feel but it\\'s still so convenient to anyplace you\\'d want to go. We easily walked all over - to and from Times Square and Broadway a couple of times, to Grand Central, back from the American Museum of Natural History, up to and through Central Park (all the way up to --th St). If you don\\'t like walking that much or the weather is bad, the closest subway station is just a little over a block away. \\r\\nThere are a lot of parking lots right around the hotel. The hotel offered to valet park for us for $-- - -- hours, but we didn\\'t mind finding parking on our own. The first one we tried (right across the street) was full, the second one we tried didn\\'t want to take our minivan, but the third one worked out (for $-- - -- hours - a great rate for the city). So be patient - there are enough around that you\\'ll get a spot.\\r\\nWhile the Murray Hill deli on the corner is nice for grabbing one or two things, there\\'s a great grocery store (D\\'Agostino\\'s) right around the corner (-rd Ave and --th St). We also really enjoyed eating lunch at the close-by Banc Cafe on -rd Ave and --th St - very low-key and relaxing atmosphere, excellent food and service. If you like Indian food, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Curry Hill\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" is just a few blocks down on Lexington. We had planned to eat down there one night, but time got away from us and we didn\\'t get to. Next time. We had Christmas breakfast at the hotel-affiliated Barking Dog, and that was great too.\\r\\nWe just got home last night, and I\\'ve already highly recommended the hotel to several people. My entire family felt extremely comfortable, and we are looking forward to going back. \\r\\nThis hotel is a real gem in the city, and I\\'m so grateful that we stumbled upon it in particular and the Affinia group in general.\\r\\nThanks to everyone at Affinia Dumont for helping to make our holiday in the city so wonderful!!',\n",

Rooms are adequate, but nothing special. While we read the complaints of street noise, I could not imagine noise up on the --th floor, but true to the reports it was incredibly noisy. I can only guess that the surrounding buildings funnel the noise to the hotel rooms. The hotel was full from business travelers and service was mediocre in general. As Hilton Diamond members we were given coupons for appetizers at the lounge.

Hotel was in a business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel.\\r\\n* Shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach\\r\\n* Pool area was fun and well designed (but only use when the pool has been cleaned)\\r\\n* well located for access to san-diego - seaworld, and legoland\\r\\nThe only reason we stayed here is because we got a --% off deal on the room, and it was close to the beach, and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids, which turned out to be NOT the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there. I would not stay here again at the same ($--- per night with) or full price.\\r\\nDetails:\\r\\n----------\\r\\n-. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable, it was clean. The 'queen' beds are actually doubles or very close to it -- much smaller 'queens' than in any other hotel we've stayed at. The kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night, The room's a-c unit was very loud, not just the normal fan sound but a loud buzzing background noise as well -- if you are a light sleeper that needs to be cool I would suggest avoiding this hotel. The rooms smell like vapor rub -- other reviewers said that the rooms smelled, and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up, it wasn't over-powering to us, but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first - minutes or so.\\r\\n-. Food and amenities -- the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access ($---day) we didn't use it, because both our smart phones have -G. Eating out in San Diego is expensive, and the hotels restaurant is no exception. We avoided the breakfast buffet at $-- per adult, $- - kid, and instead walked a block to the nearby Green Leaf Cafe (a business cafe) and got a decent breakfast for the whole family for $---$--. We also found that the hotels happy happy hour between ---pm was great, and during that time would split a few appetizers ($--- each vs $----- per entree during regular hours) for dinner with the kids, however most nights we didn't make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over.\\r\\n-. The pool -- if you have kids who love to swim, and are coming to this hotel to use the pool, be WARNED, there are some caveats.To save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week, and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on Thursday and Friday. We arrived on Monday night, and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool -- and in about - minutes we were disgusted (rating D-). There were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool, there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool (maxipad, diaper, or tissue -- I'm not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out). In addition to the gross stuff on the bottom, the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs, bugs, normal pool debris, etc. The pool pump and filters were NOT running. There was a large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot-tub. In addition, there were mosquitos outside, and I ended up getting bitten several times that evening, even tho we were outdoors for about -- min.\\r\\nAll of us who swam that night (me and the two kids) had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days -- tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these. I was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day.\\r\\nWe avoided the pool for the next few days, mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach, sea world, and legoland -- but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of a broken pump and it would be better the next time. Friday morning we had a chance to check out the pool again, and it looked to our amazement, much better -- I would say a B+ rating. Friday night they had a movie showing in the pool area, which was a lot of fun -- and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it.\\r\\nOther reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool, and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate.\\r\\n-. Laundry -- there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in -- very disapointing. As we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us, while the other took care of the laundry. The hotel does have a laundry service, but given the prices of everything else there, I suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do a family of fours --days worth of laundry -- so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie, and spend Friday night at the landromat at del mar heights, and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed. \\r\\n-. Shuttle: The hotel provides a free shuttle to anywhere within - miles of the hotel, which includes del mar beach -- this was the best beach we found for quality (bathrooms and changing area were amazing here) and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves. When I called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions, the operator was fairly curt and impatient. But the shuttle service was nice -- the picked us up at a cafe we found near the beach.\\r\\n-a. Speaking of the beach: the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel. We asked at the front desk while we were there, and they said there was NO safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel, unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids. This seems like false advertising to me.\\r\\n-. Yelp -- if you have a smart phone and a car, Yelp! came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat. The GPS-google maps were also invaluable.\",\n",

I don\\'t smoke, but am not an obsessive anti-smoker and usually have no problem in this situation. THESE ROOMS WERE VILE! The smoke smell was unbelievably oppressive.

I would suggest using the valet if you are forced to stay here b-c this is the venue chosen by your company or professional assn.

Upon entering my room, it sounded as though they booked me in the engine room of a cruise ship - the room was extremely loud, and I suspect that the air conditioning unit for the entire hotel was directly above this room. \\r\\nKnowing I wouldn\\'t get a wink of sleep if I stayed in this room, I proceeded back to the front desk where I was told that the only room available was a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"parlor\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room.

So my choices are the engine room or a room without an actual bed. I chose the latter....\\r\\nUp to this room I headed.... The room was quite large, with a dining table that sat at least - people. The carpets were stained in multiple areas, and there were a number of cobwebs on the light fixtures. Again - I\\'m not too pleased with the room, but they had promised to move me to an actual room the following day. Since I was tired, and the only thing that they\\'d end up doing for me is putting me in another parlor room, I sucked it up and stayed in this room.\\r\\nTo the hotel\\'s credit, they did move me to a suitable room the following day and did comp me a breakfast in their restaurant. The room that I ended up in after the first night was clean, but as many others have commented, this place needs a significant remodeling - the place reminded me of a late ----\\'s Marriott.\\r\\nI was attending a conference at this hotel, and must also mention two things. First of all, the first day of the meeting, the air conditioning in the conference room was not working sufficiently. Many in attendance were visibly uncomfortable from the heat and humidity (myself included) - it made it difficult to concentrate. Also, the cellular and wifi signals in the conference rooms are non-existent. When you exit the room, the signal is fine in the foyer, but poor in the actual room. This made it difficult for me because I had a couple of calls I was expecting, so I found myself nervously exiting the room regularly.\\r\\nOne last experience I must mention... On the second night, I visited the bar and had a couple of drinks. When ready to retire for the evening, I asked for the bill and noticed that I was overcharged by one drink. When I brought it to the attention of the bartender, I was met with arguing that I did, in fact, have the drink in question. I like to consider myself a trustworthy person, and for the bartender to argue with me and question my truthfulness was an insult to me. I wasn\\'t trying to scam him out of money, nor would it have been any skin off his back to just correct the bill. Knowing that I wasn\\'t getting anywhere, I ended up just paying for the extra drink and leaving a lousy tip. He argued his way out of his tip.....\\r\\nIf I ever have to attend a meeting at this hotel in the future, I will probably stay elsewhere and use the Metro to get to the L\\'enfant - the Metro is actually conveniently located under the hotel, which makes getting around town quite convenient.\\r\\nMy recommendation - stay away from the L\\'enfant Plaza Hotel until significant changes are made to this property.',\n",

       " \"Just returned from a one night stay at the Westin waterfront. I would have liked to give this a -.-, but I will give this hotel the benefit of an added half-star in lieu of one less. For us, however, this was a great all around experience.\\r\\nFirst, we went to this hotel for a one night romantic getaway- we recently got married, but havent had time for a honeymoon so it was just a brief getaway from our house which is probably only - miles away. The Westin provided a great escape. Here's a breakdown of the things I noticed.\\r\\n-The lobby is huge, with a modern decor, and a open lobby bar. However despite being a very modern theme, the use of live birch trees, dark wood, and vibrant art makes it feel comfortable and not cold. This is not your typical Boston hotel, and that is one of the reasons I wanted to stay here.\\r\\n- Our room was the standard size and for Boston, I have to say it was quite large. The bathroom was unremarkable, although the mirror was fantastic- it was surrounded by a light making it easy for putting on makeup, etc. The TV was a LG -- inch HD, and the picture and sound were fantastic. The selection of channels was better than most hotel rooms, and most channels were in HD. Our view was actually pretty great even though we didn't pay for a room with a view- it is an interesting perspective of Boston from that location, and we enjoyed just watching our city. The window was the entire wall. The furnishings in the room continue the modern but almost nature-feel with warm, earthy tones. The heavenly bed was, as always, heavenly.\\r\\n-The workout facility was spotless with all brand new equipment. The treadmills were far better than at my own gym. The pool was small, but clean, and the hot-tub was, strangely, metal.\\r\\n-Dining- we had drinks in the Birch Bar in the lobby- expensive cocktails, but the friendly bartender gave us a round for free. We had the Sea Salt french fries and they were soooo good. You get to choose a few sauces that come from the restaurant, Sauciety. I definitely recommend the Whiskey Spiked Ketchup. We ate dinner and breakfast in the room. Dinner was actually great, and for room-service in Boston, reasonably priced. Breakfast on the other hand, was the downside. VERY expensive ($-- for the standard American Breakfast). The eggs were watery and weird, and the pancakes were salty. It was included in our rate, so we werent that dissapointed. \\r\\n-Service. We had simply outstanding service all around. My husband mentioned that we were there for a special occassion, and when we returned to our room from the Birch Bar, we found a bottle of expensive champagne and a plate of four delicious chocolate desserts. Room service was prompt, and when we requested extra pillows, they were there in under - minutes. The bartender downstairs was great, and check-in and check out were efficient.\\r\\nSo the bottom line- I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the location, though if you get a good rate, I would go for it. Also, in warmer months, it really wouldnt be that bad to walk places. We paid --- for the room which included in room breakfast and a -pm checkout. The Starwood website often includes great rates, especially last minute, but it helps to know how to navigate it. However, there have regularly been affordable rates, even as low as ---. Either of these is a steal for Boston. I would strongly recommend this hotel for locals looking for a getaway, others looking for a more quiet location, and certainly for conventioners. It wasn't quite perfect b-c of the breakfast, and the bathroom could have been a bit larger. Nonetheless, this is a great Westin property.\",\n",

       " \"We stayed in the tower, less expensive, and the room was a very nice Hilton type room. If you stay in the tower, book early and ask for a room overlooking the grounds and the bay, as opposed to the interstate. Very nice pool area and being right on the bay is a definite plus. Restaurant much better than I expected at a Hilton. Great location, easy to get anywhere as long as you have a car, which is pretty much a necessity in San Diego.

It was like the Amazing Race! Everyone trying to get out of town. We ended up taking a Greyhound to NYC and were able to get a train home.

I have always found the rooms clean and quiet, beds very comfortable and service attentive but not overbearing. Check in is always fast and the staff is always friendly and efficient. The colors of the lobby and rooms are very neutral but relaxing after a long days work. The bathrooms are clean and modern with great shower heads. The fitness facility is very nice with a good variety of equipment. It is a large space so you do not feel like the gym was a afterthought. The restaurant and bar are on the second floor and I have eaten here often instead of going out for dinner. Food is fresh and very good, eating at the bar is welcome and a good experience if you are a solo diner. If you are a loyal Starwood customer you will find this DC hotel vastly better than the experience at the DC Four Points, and not nearly as expensive as the W and St. Regis.

We did run into a flaw of not having a room with a frig and micro, but he rectified it immediately. He told me when remodeling is complete they will all have these items. The room was clean. The pool was large and the kids loved it. My husband was thrilled with the fact that an affordable motel had a fitness center. I spent a majority of time on the computer in the complimentary business center, set up in the lobby. I was able to continue to book and plan the rest of our road trip through the use of their computer. There was no additional charge for printing off the web pages. This was helpful. I would only ask them to change two things. First, you access everything from the outside, so they should not refer to themselves as a hotel, but rather a motel. Second, they should offer at least some type of complimentary breakfast, cookies, or something. Most hotels do in Austin and if they took the time to clean up the physical facility and their image, since it switched owners, it would be a final touch. Further more, I feel their extras at the price offered, put them above the other motels in their class. This should be incentive enough for budgeted travelers looking for a little more for their money. They should not trick the public by saying things like, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hotel\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\".

Its certainly no ordinary Marriott hotel, this is boutique style, good small cozy restaurant, trendy and cool bar and very personal well decorated rooms with a very engaging service.\\r\\nGeneral standard of the hotel - very good to excellent\\r\\nStandard of the rooms - excellent (although quite small rooms)\\r\\nLobby - small but cozy and good for meeting colleagues - friends\\r\\nRestaurant - small, cozy, good food and good service\\r\\nGym - excellent\\r\\nService - very good to excellent (especially the servicing of the rooms was top notch.

When we arrived after a long drive we were told that our room wasn't ready, even though it was after the check-in time, and that we should come back in an hour. When we did return and were waiting in the lobby I had to ask whether the room was ready, it was obviously too much for a member of staff to come over and inform me.\\r\\nThe room we booked was supposed to have views of either Nob Hill or Union Square - ours had neither. The room was very small and felt dated. When I complained to the front desk I was initially told that the hotel was full but the manager did manage to find a different room.

It was a larger room but it still felt dated.\\r\\nThe beds were incredible uncomfortable. My wife and I shared one bed and my children shared the other bed.

Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - - maintenance staff members and -- minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $-- voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.\\r\\nMy first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by --.-- am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, - minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's -- night stay.\\r\\nThis hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.\\r\\nWhile the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation.

I almost never think there are adequate blankets on the bed but there were here. And the breakfast was much more than we hoped for by the description of 'continental breakfast'. There was an omelet station where you could choose from fresh ingredients and have it made to order, plus biscuits and gravy, waffles, tons of fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, and all the other cereals, muffins and pastries you would normally expect. The only downfalls were some cosmetic repairs that needed attention, both in the halls and our room, and the tv really needed updating.

       " \"Our trip to visit Washington, DC was from ---- to -----. We stayed in a deluxe King nonsmoking room at the Omni Shoreham that was located in the West wing on the seventh floor. We had a view to the back of the hotel over the pool. I had found a special for $--- a night through Travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel. The room was not large, but was comfortable enough. The rack rate on the door was $---. A small fridge was in the TV cabinet with drawers was convenient. Beds were great. The bathroom was compact but there was a short shelf under the sink to use and a shelf over the toilet. Tub had a short shelf on the back and had a curved shower rail so it was fine; nice showerhead. TV reception would be great and then go snowy at times. The small walk-in closet did not have a light so I made good use of the flashlight I packed. Good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse. Glass knobs on bath and closet door, and a full-size mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open. I had to ask the housekeeper for robes and a foam pillow the second morning of our stay, and she had this for us when we returned to our room later. Being a Select Guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning, and we opted for a bagel or English muffin ($-.-- each) that kept us going until lunch later in the day; a few times napkins-silverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old, tough and rock hard (only complaint we really had). One day we ordered some snacks in the evening, and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special. We had a few desserts from Morsels we had bought downstairs. Internet signal was weak and an Ethernet bridge was provided, I ended up using my data card I have which was faster. We ate at Robert's in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good. Staff and service was excellent from the bellmen, check-in-front desk, concierge, maid, room service, and engineers. Staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted. The hotel lobby is grand, the roses changed several times during the week, and the lobby floor shines immaculately – definitely impressive! Our room was very clean. The bath rug was removed and missing a few days, so we asked for another one. We spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean, which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp. We were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel, and believed it was four diamond quality. It cost us $-- plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from National airport (you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing), and $-- plus tip back from the Omni through Abe's sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and I with luggage. We were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior Trip Advisor reviews so that was no surprise. We experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip. Many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on. Everything was still handled quickly which impressed us, despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways. We loved the hotel and if returning to Washington, DC area would definitely stay here again at the Omni Shoreham. We heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison. \\r\\nThe metro is close by and convenient to the Omni. We purchased Smart Trip cards ($- each) at Metro Central (about three stops from Woodley Park so it costs $-.-- to get there) and I put on $-- for my card and $-- for my husband's card (he is a senior so his fare rates were half price). We still had some money left on the cards after two weeks. You can go to the website metroopensdoors.com to get directions from Woodley Park to wherever you want to go which is convenient. The Smart Trip cards also get you on some local area buses, including the DC Circulator that we used to get to Georgetown. \\r\\nWe did the Grayline Double Decker (hop on and hop off) tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel – you have two days to use your ticket and we LOVED this bus tour! Excellent and highly recommend it. We liked it so much we did a six-hour tour on another day with Grayline to go see Mt. Vernon (go to Union Station before - AM to buy your ticket and board). \\r\\nOur first 'tour' vendor we had tried on our second night was through Royal Trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight - it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van; another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was 'okay' but not great like they had experienced before. I would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night – and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in Washington, DC. \\r\\nPlaces we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood: We tried the Lebanese Taverna on Connecticut one night, but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good – neither my husband or I would recommend going there and it was around $---person. We tried the Café Paridiso on Connecticut Ave. the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on TripAdvisor but were disappointed and would not return. \\r\\nFavorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel - Open City Café across on Calvert Street. Petits Plats around the block on Connecticut Ave. is excellent – we ate there our last night; order the 'floating island' for dessert. Petits Plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out. We ordered Chinese take-out once (lunch specials and soup) from the Eddie Cafe across on Calvert (but address says Connecticut Ave) and were favorably impressed and recommend. Chipolte's is on Calvert across the street too - good Mexican food and guacamole-chips for a reasonable price - we ate there several times. We had McDonald's a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too (they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel). The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies, chips, sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel. We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located. A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip; if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby, however. \\r\\nThere is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the 'best' cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs – we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting! If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes, be sure to stop! It is not far from the Grayline Hop-on, hop-off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle. \\r\\nOur favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend (worth the trip) is the Old Ebbitt Grill (a historic landmark since ----) at --- --th St. near the White House in Washington – we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once – excellent food, good prices, and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area. We also ate at Fago de Chao at ---- Pennsylvania Ave. (near the Old Post Office Tower); it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food – a treat but will run you $---person plus tax and tip. We ate once at McCormick & Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good. We ate lunch once at Ella's Wood Fired Pizza which was good. The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food. We also liked the buffet at the Garden Café in the National Gallery of Art at -th and Constitution N.W. which filled us up for the afternoon activities. \\r\\nOne of the best maps we used was 'Washington: The Nation's Capital' that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitor's Center. We took several with us, had some others, but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around, and we went back to get more. \\r\\nThe International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit. Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin (between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials). If you want some good bargains, ladies will enjoy Filene's Basement to shop. We explored Alexandria, and Georgetown (check out the canals there in Georgetown) as well as Washington, DC. We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the 'O line' which was amazing. Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour, the Library of Congress (amazing), and the Bureau of Engraving. The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience, and an excellent base to explore Washington, DC and the surrounding area. A wonderful and memorable trip for us – the fall leaves made it even more spectacular!\",\n",

The reason I'm writing this review is to share with everyone the fantastic and honest staff of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel by the Galleria. I specifically would like to highlight Mahom. I accidentally left my beloved David Yurman ring (a college graduation present from my parents) on the sink in the lobby bathroom. I then left the hotel and got in a cab to the airport. Mahom found my ring in the bathroom and instead of keeping it she kindly, honestly and thoughtfully set it aside in the hotel office for someone to claim. As I was pulling in at the airport I realized I didn't have the ring and called the hotel. Mahom answered and told me she had found it and it was there waiting for me. The cab driver turned around and took me back to retrieve it. I cannot thank Mahom enough for reunited me with this very sentimental and valuable piece of jewelry. I would have been heartbroken to have lost it and I cannot thank Mahom enough. Mahom and the rest of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel staff are a fantastic group of people and I highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in North Dallas. Thank you again, Mahom, and I will certainly stay at the Sheraton on my next Dallas trip.\",\n",

I can certainly see why. The lobby is not trendy, or sexy, but it is grand and full of the finest marble. There must be -- different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone. \\r\\nPlease promise me you will visit the in-house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant, at least for a drink. It\\'s quite a scene! Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out. There is this feature where they make it rain and a band plays on a moving boat. I felt like I was really in Tahiti. (even though I had never been) Also worth a drink is the Top of the Mark Bar and Lounge right across the street in the Intercontinental hotel. One minute I had amazing views of all of SF, and the next minute we were encompassed in fog. \\r\\nDo like I did and sign up for the President\\'s Club for free, before you check inn. It will get you free internet, gym usage, and a daily paper. You can do it at the Fairmont website. \\r\\nMy only problem and it\\'s not the hotels fault, is those darn hills! Some say it adds character to the city; I simply find it annoying. I\\'m -- and in decent shape and I was huffing and puffing when returning from a dinner of bar around the area. They are more like little mountains.

Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility. The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured. In fact no gates are closed, security cameras are facing backwards -- it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars.\\r\\nThe hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage -- fair enough -- but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby - when they know the parking is not secure overnight. They are a hotel -- they know the cars are going to be there overnight!\\r\\nI would not recommend anyone stay at the Buckmister if they are traveling with a car.',\n",

Unedited rap music with explicit sexual lyrics including all types of profanity that could send you down to he final level of hell Once all passengers were loaded into the vehicle the driver did NOT turn off the music or change the station This is the absolute WORST hotel experience I have ever had I will NEVER stay at it again even if it were free and I will make sure none of my friends or family ever have to go through what I went through again',\n",

First impressions? Evidently notThe first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains It was horrible and kept us up at night Furthermore the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean We had to call housekeeping three times Each time they would come they didnt correct the problems We gave up We tried to change rooms but were told the Were completely sold out line We made our reservations for this trip in July Were Hilton Honors members - who cares Anyway the next day we changed rooms and while the room was better we still experienced problems with water for instance on two mornings the water ran brown with silt Not goodThe restaurant Lockwood did not open until Thanksgiving Day despite being advertised as opening weeks before We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior I must say the retaurant is terrible The whole layout stinks The ceilings are far too low the tables are bare no table cloths no flowers no candles Stark The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant Its a zig-zig game getting to and from Not only that but we ate there for breakfast each morning simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable There are plenty of waiters hanging about but I dont think the manager has told them what to do yet No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning No coffee the next morning Funny enough we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience No kidding Id avoid this place To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??

The bed was very firm I had no problem but the wife didnt sleep well because it was too firm for her) The pillows were the typical synthetic non-allergic spun polyester type which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee) but if you use just one pillow your head will sink to the mattress which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers)The next morning We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room With the exception of the repeated high pitched angry screaming and squeals of someones precious little darling outside our door No I want the something or other) as we packed up to check out we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway So noise was generally not a problemCheckout was easy and took all of twenty seconds We were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there We probably will not stay there again because we honestly dont really have a reason to return to the area I think for a business professional who doesnt have an expense account and isnt reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however it would be a good inexpensive option as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before -pm you double check your reservation bring your own pillow coffee and shampoo and you dont expect the four seasons or the fairmont for $--',\n",

good Mexican food and guacamole-chips for a reasonable price - we ate there several times We had McDonalds a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel) The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies chips sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby however There is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the best cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs – we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes be sure to stop It is not far from the Grayline Hop-on hop-off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle Our favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend worth the trip) is the Old Ebbitt Grill a historic landmark since ----) at --- --th St near the White House in Washington – we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once – excellent food good prices and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area We also ate at Fago de Chao at ---- Pennsylvania Ave near the Old Post Office Tower) it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food – a treat but will run you $---person plus tax and tip We ate once at McCormick  Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good We ate lunch once at Ellas Wood Fired Pizza which was good The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food We also liked the buffet at the Garden Café in the National Gallery of Art at -th and Constitution NW which filled us up for the afternoon activities One of the best maps we used was Washington The Nations Capital that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitors Center We took several with us had some others but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around and we went back to get more The International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials) If you want some good bargains ladies will enjoy Filenes Basement to shop We explored Alexandria and Georgetown check out the canals there in Georgetown) as well as Washington DC We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the O line which was amazing Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour the Library of Congress amazing) and the Bureau of Engraving The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience and an excellent base to explore Washington DC and the surrounding area A wonderful and memorable trip for us – the fall leaves made it even more spectacular',\n",
